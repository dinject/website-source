<h2 id="dinject">DInject Dependency Injection</h2>
<p>
  DInject is designed to be a fast and light dependency injection library for server-side Java and Kotlin
  developers.
</p>
<p>
  It is fast and light by using source code generation (like Dagger). There is no use of reflection or classpath
  scanning.
</p>
<p>
  It is orientated to server-side use by providing similar functionality to Spring DI including Lifecycle support,
  @Factory + @Bean and the ability to get beans from the context (which is what we need in order to use DI for
  web route controllers for use with Javalin and other web libraries).
</p>

<h2 id="aop">No AOP</h2>
<p>
  Currently DInject does not include AOP. The expectation is that AOP functionality comes
  with other libraries - for example Ebean ORM has <code>@Transactional</code> and Metrics
  libraries have their own <code>@Timed</code>.
</p>
<p>
  If we can stick to these additional libraries providing their own AOP/enhancement that has
  the benefit that DInject has no requirement for creating <em>Dynamic Proxies</em> which
  have relatively expensive startup cost.
